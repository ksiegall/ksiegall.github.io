## Description
For my Humanities Practicum at WPI, I elected to take a class called Musical Robotics. The goal of the class was to develop an innovative musical robot, from theory to implementation, in just seven weeks.

Based on a childrenâ€™s toy from the 80s, the Whirly Tune is a customizable ensemble of corrugated tubes mounted to motors that each produce a unique pitch when spun. Controlled by three separate Raspberry Pi Picos, our design is highly modular and customizable. With a timbre that is both eerie and ethereal Whirly Tune has the potential to be the perfect accompaniment to many performances.

Whirly Tunes is controlled by a serial connection to Ableton via a patch written in Max MSP. This means it can easily perform MIDI pieces or be played in real time via a MIDI keyboard.
