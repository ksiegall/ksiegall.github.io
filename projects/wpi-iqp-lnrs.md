## Abstract

The goal of this project was to provide recommendations to the Worcestershire Local Nature Recovery Strategies (LNRS) Preparation Team for how access and perceptions of local green spaces can be enhanced alongside habitat creation and restoration. At events with the sponsors, infographic boards were used to gather direct data from residents in two communities of Worcestershire County (Westlands Estate and Warndon Villages) about their opinions and perceptions about the green spaces near them. An online survey was also used to gather related data based on certain demographics, and several local project groups were contacted and interviewed on how they would improve green spaces and access to them. It was observed and documented that while perceptions of green space quality and accessibility were similar between the two communities, there were more observable issues with the Westlands’ infrastructure and knowledge of green spaces. It was determined that there were many educational, infrastructural and engagement-based initiatives that the LNRS Preparation Team can undertake to help both communities improve their access to local green spaces and residents’ knowledge of the green spaces.
